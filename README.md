# [PPT slides] IoT Fundamentals
These slides were developed following the book:
IoT Fundamentals: Networking Technologies, Protocols, and Use Cases for the Internet of Things, CISCO Process.

This book, in my opinion, offers a systematic insight into the IoT technology, including the architecture, access technology, IP over IoT, application protocols, etc. The contents covered by the slides include Chapters 1-8. 

Some add-ons based on my understanding and materials found from the Internet were included as well.

Enjoy the world of IoT!!!
